# WeatherAppDjango
 
A simple webapp been building to learn Django framework and web development

I am trying to learn the Django framework and the best way to learn anything is by doing a project yourself. So I decided to take on a challenge and produce a web app.
I have 0 experience in Django, html, css. So I had to learn all of these from scratch.  I had started learning Django Last week.

I have corporate some of my own CSS that I have learnt as well as using bootstrap for the majority of the styling.

I plan on working and producing more web app in order to enchance my skill with the framework as well as expose my self in other areas I am not familiar with,
